# RacingGameScoreAnalysis

# Overview:

This project analyzes Metacritic's Top 200 racing games by Metascore (https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/genre/metascore/racing/all?view=detailed).

# Methodology:

Data was recorded using Google Sheets, then transferred and cleaned in Microsoft Excel. Further data cleaning was done in SQL, as well as some rudimentary analysis. Then, the cleaned data was loaded into Tableau for visualizaton.
(Scores are on a 100 point system- 100 points being the highest, 0 being the lowest possible score).

# Questions:

-With this project, I had a few questions to potential analysis:

-Is there any difference in average score between Consoles?

-Is there a bias towards "Retro" vs. "Modern" games (Pre-2008 vs. 2009-Today)?


-Which genres (Arcade, Simulation, Rally) score highest? 

-Which popular series has the highest average score?

-What years have the most games on the list?

# Outcomes:

-The Nintendo DS has the highest score, however, there was only 1 game released on this platform in the list. Next up is the Sony PS1 (8 games), then the Nintendo Switch (2 games), followed by the Xbox Series X/S (3 games).
-The average scores are comparable- 87.358 for Retro vs. 87.009 for Modern. However, there seems to be more variance for Retro games (ranging from 84-96), as opposed to Modern (ranging from 84-94).
-Sim games (87.316) and Arcade games (87.282) score higher than Rally (86.143) games. 
-The highest average goes to the Gran Turismo (92), then Test Drive (89.5), and then Forza (88.5). The Need for Speed Series averaged at 87.2.
-The most released in a year were 8 games, in 2003 and 2005.
